		<h2>OUR STORY </h2>
		<p>Inhabitent Camping Supply Co. has been Vancouver camping supply icon for more than two whole<br>
		 months! Customers often comment on the bustle of activity they see in store…that’s where the magic<br>
		 happens every day. </p>
		<p> We want to bridge the gap between the comfort of city life and the lovely Instagram-worthiness of<br>
		the great outdoors that surround us. We sell gear that’s fun and functional. So much fun, in fact, that<br>
		you’ll want to pitch a tent inside your one-bedroom apartment so you can use it every day.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>OUR TEAM</h2>
		<p> nhabitent Camping Supply Co.’s staff is made up of an amazing team of inspired retail associates.<br>
		 We really know our stuff when it comes to travel hammocks and campfire cooking gadgets. From a<br>
		 provincial park campground to the back-country, our staff knows what you need to outfit your<br>
		 outdoor outing.<br> </P>
		 <p>Our shop is nestled away in a lovely little corner of Vancouver. Pop in, say hi, and try out our tents!</p>
